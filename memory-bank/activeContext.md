## Recent Changes

### Particle System Improvements (April 2024)
1. Fixed white particle visibility issues:
   - Modified `PointParticle` component to only show particles during active drifting
   - Removed special case for white particles that was making them always visible
   - Reduced particle size from 0.1 to 0.02 to make them less distracting
   - Slowed growth rate from delta * 0.5 to delta * 0.2
   - Reduced maximum particle size from 0.2 to 0.1

2. Character Selection UI Improvements:
   - Fixed scroll bar issue by changing `overflow-y: auto` to `overflow: hidden`
   - Set `max-height: 100vh` for better screen fit
   - Added `overflow: hidden` to nested containers to prevent potential scrolling

### Drift and Boost System Overhaul (April 2024)
1. Replaced abstract "turbo" terms with realistic fire terminology
2. Changed drift effect colors to match real flame temperature progression:
   - Small fire: Light blue-white (cooler flame)
   - Medium fire: Warm orange-yellow (medium heat)
   - Hot fire: Intense red (hottest flame)
3. Adjusted thresholds for more natural progression:
   - Small fire threshold: 3 (lowered for quick feedback)
   - Medium fire threshold: 16 (balanced middle tier)
   - Hot fire threshold: 35 (challenging but achievable)
4. Fixed boost force issues:
   - Reduced max boost force from 20000 to 200 in gamepad controller
   - Standardized boost values across all controller types
5. Implemented post-boost phase:
   - Added gradual speed reduction after boost ends
   - Top speed limit gradually decreases over time
   - Smooth transition from boost speed to normal speed
