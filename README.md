# MemeKart - JavaScript/WebGL Meme Racing Game

## Game Overview

MemeKart is a web-based racing game inspired by classic kart racing games but featuring internet meme characters and themes. Built with JavaScript, Three.js, and React, it offers fun arcade-style racing with drift mechanics, items, and character-specific stats.

**Current Development Status:** Approximately 50% complete - core mechanics implemented, with more features planned.

## Credits

This game is based on [Mario Kart JS](https://github.com/Lunakepio/Mario-Kart-3.js) by Lunakepio. MemeKart builds upon this foundation with additional features and meme-themed content.

- Three.js - 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber - React bindings for Three.js
- Zustand - State management
- React-Three/Rapier - Physics engine
- Vitest - Testing framework

### Editor Support

The project supports [Triplex](https://triplex.dev/download) for visual editing of components:

- Open the project in Triplex from the root directory
- Edit components visually and see changes in real-time
- [Learn more about Triplex](https://triplex.dev/docs/get-started/user-interface)

## Testing

This project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

Tests cover:

- Game state management (store)
- UI components (Landing, HUD)
- Integration between components

## Features Implemented

### Keyboard Controls on Landing Screen

- Displays all keyboard controls clearly to users on the initial landing page
- Shows both WASD and arrow key alternatives
- Uses a similar visual style to match the game's aesthetic
- Controls appear automatically with the logo and "PRESS ENTER TO START" button
- Responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop devices

### Character Selection Screen

- Interactive selection of popular meme characters with visual preview
- Features memes like Doge, Grumpy Cat, Pepe, Wojak, Cheems, and Chadoge
- Displays character stats (Speed, Acceleration, Handling)
- Shows visual indicators for character attributes
- Character selection affects gameplay
- Clean, responsive UI that matches the game's meme aesthetic

### Speed Display

- Dynamic speed indicator in the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Shows the kart's speed in KM/H with a racing-style display
- Features a transparent background with blue glow effects
- Updates in real-time as you drive
- Converts raw speed values to more realistic kilometers per hour

### Key Mechanics

#### Drift System
The drift system uses a classic Mario Kart approach:
- Hold jump (Spacebar/RB) while turning to initiate drift
- Continue holding to accumulate drift power
- Drift power progresses from blue → orange → purple
- Release to get a mini-turbo boost of corresponding power

#### Physics
The game uses Rapier for physics calculations:
- Realistic collision detection and response
- Character weight affecting handling and collision
- Wall bouncing with recovery periods
- Ground detection via raycasting

#### Character Stats
Characters have different attributes that affect gameplay:
- **Speed**: Maximum velocity
- **Acceleration**: How quickly top speed is reached
- **Handling**: Turning responsiveness
- **Weight**: Affects physics and stability
